<h1>CATTSS</h1>
<h2>Computer Assisted Transcription Through Subword Spotting</h2>
<p>This is the crowd-source transcription app I've created for my Master's thesis at BYU. It is designed for a smartphone screen, but should be usable in any modern browser.</p>
<p>I'm running a short expirement which should only take 5 minutes of your time.</p>

<h2>How CATTSS works</h2>
<p>The system begins by looking for common subwords ('th', 'er', etc.) in the text. It can't do this very well by itself. It passes the results it has meduim confidence for to the users. Based on their feedback it increases in its descriminative power, eventually reaching a point it can make a decision about the rest of them.</p>
<p>The subwords form a partail transcription of words. Comparing these to a lexicon, the system determines the possible transcriptions for a partail transcribed word. If this list is reasonibly small the system passes the list to a user to select the correct one.</p>
<p>The system additionally uses the subwords approved by users, and the now known letters of user transcribed words to enhance its ability to find subwords.</p>
