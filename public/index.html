<h1>CATTSS</h1>
<h2>Computer Assisted Transcription Through Subword Spotting</h2>
<!--
<p>This app has been created as part of a thesis at BYU. It gives volunteers like you the chance to help an automated system transcribe handwritten documents. It is in the testing phase now, so if youâ€™re willing to help, click the link below to go through a short experiment. It should take about 10 minutes.</p>
<p><b>It is intended for touchscreens</b>, but you should be able to use any computer.</p>
-->
<p>The latest test I did is finished. If you'd like to help with a later one, use the button below.<p>

<h2>How CATTSS works</h2>
<p>The system begins by looking for common letter combinations (subwords) like 'th' or 'er'. It can't do this very well by itself, so it passes subwords it is unsure about on to users.</p>
<p>When the computer has a few letters filled in for a word (think of the game "Wheel of Fortune" - some letters are known, some are blank), it creates a list of possible transcriptions for that word. If this list is reasonably small it passes it to a user to select the correct one.</p>
<p>The system also uses the subwords approved by users, and the now known letters of user transcribed words to enhance its ability to find subwords.</p>
